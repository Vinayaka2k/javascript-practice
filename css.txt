- Border
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-color: green; 
    border-radius: 10px; 
    border-radius: 50%; 

- Set bg color of an ele
    background-color: silver;

- Order of specificity of applying css for class, id of an ele
    id has higher specificity than class

- Padding
    Distance b/w contents of an ele and border of the ele
    padding: 20px;
    padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right

- Margin
    Distance b/w border of an ele and the surrounding elements
    If margin of an ele increases, then that ele shrinks (SINCE dist b/w its border and parent ele increases)
    margin: 20px;
    If we set the margin -ve; then the ele tries to grow out of its parent ele
