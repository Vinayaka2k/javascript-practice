-   In JS, all functions are first class func and behave like normal variables- 
meaning funcs can be assigned to var, passed into another func, or returned from a func

-   In FP, all funcs are pure, meaning they dont change any params passed to them or other data and thus doesnt cause any side effects
-   In FP, all dependent vars must be passed as params to the function and global var must not be used inside funcs
