-   this
refers to the object that invoked the method

-  check type of object using instance of :
obj instanceof Class

-   check type of object using constructor property :
-   constructor property points to the Class which created the object
let obj = new Class()
check : obj.constructor === Class

-   obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)
returns T if obj has prop as it's own property
returns F if obj has prop as the prototype property

-   Add a property to an object's prototype if the value for this object is same across all instances; reduce duplication
obj.prototype.property = value;

-   for(let prop in obj){
    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop))
        // prop is the own property of duck
    else
        // prop is the prototype property of duck
}
