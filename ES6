let vs var :
-   using var gets global scope for the decalred variable; but using let, we can limit the scope to declared
loop / block

-   using const for decalring an array, the individual members of arrays are still mutable

-   Object.freeze(obj) : use this to freeze an object defined using const

-   reset paramter :
const foo = (...args) => {
    args is an array of variable no of params
}

spread operator :
-   unpacks the array & used to spread the array 
-   can only be used in function or inside arrays; const arr1 = ...arr2 would be error
