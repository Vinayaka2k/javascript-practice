Javascript -

common methods : 
str.length -> Length of a string
arr.push -> append to array
arr.unshift -> add ele to beginning
arr.pop -> returns popped ele
arr.shift -> removes first ele and returns it


other imp things to remember :
string values are immutable
arrays are heterogenous
variables declared anywhere without let or const are considered to be global
in global vs local var; local var takes the precedence
if there is no return for a function; it returns undefined
