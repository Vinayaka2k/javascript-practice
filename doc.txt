Javascript -

common methods : 
str.length -> Length of a string
arr.push -> append to array
arr.unshift -> add ele to beginning
arr.pop -> returns popped ele
arr.shift -> removes first ele and returns it
typeof ___


other imp things to remember :
string values are immutable
arrays are heterogenous
variables declared anywhere without let or const are considered to be global
in global vs local var; local var takes the precedence
if there is no return for a function; it returns undefined
== doesnot consider type of data of operands; but strictly equal to considers datatypes as well
> and < operators check loosely by datatype of operands
while chaining elseif; its not mandatory that it ends with an else
